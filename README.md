# PROJECT: JAVASCRIPT TIC-TAC-TOE

In this project we built a Tic Tac Toe game rendered in the browser(no backend). This project follows the lesson about Factory Functions and The Module Pattern so the main goal is to put into practice those concepts along with the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes/objects and how to access their methods and attributes.
